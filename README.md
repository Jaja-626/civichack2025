## Problem

In today's digital age, there's a growing disconnect between young people and the natural world. This contributes to a lack of appreciation and urgency in preserving biodiversity and addressing global warming. 

Education on biodiversity is often overlooked, leading to a widespread lack of understanding about its importance and the consequences of biodiversity loss. Many people are unaware of the critical role biodiversity plays in maintaining ecosystem stability, supporting food security, and mitigating climate change.

FloraTheExplorer offers an interactive platform where students can explore flora worldwide through the Harvard University Herbaria Libraries database. By clicking on plants, they learn about their characteristics, ecological roles, and climate change impacts. The timeline tool shows plant discoveries and aims to inspire environmental conservation efforts. 

## Map

Our Interactive Global Plant Biodiversity Map is a powerful tool designed to visualize and explore plant diversity across different regions and time periods. Using the data from Harvard University Herbaria Libraries database, this interactive map allows users to click on individual plant markers to access detailed information, making it an engaging resource for education, research, and conservation efforts.

Key Features: <br>
🌍 Global Coverage – View plant biodiversity across the world, with markers indicating plant locations based on longitude and latitude data.<br>
🔎 Clickable Plant Markers – Users can click on plant icons to retrieve specific information, enhancing learning and awareness. <br>
📅 Time Slider – Explore how biodiversity has changed over time, from 1800 to the present, helping to visualize trends in species distribution and potential biodiversity loss. <br>
📊 Research & Conservation Tool – Useful for researchers and conservationists looking to analyze biodiversity hotspots, track plant distribution, and identify areas requiring protection.<be>

The plant data was scraped from the hard drive and Harvard University Herbaria Libraries database and converted into csv files using pandas and then parsed using Papaparse, a python library. The map was implemented using a Javascript library called Leaflet which allowed for easy placement of markers based on longitude and latitude data which was scraped from the database.
